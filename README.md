## Development Approach

- Modular and well-structured design with clear separation of responsibilities and attention to long-term maintainability
- Disciplined memory management with explicit ownership, lifetime control, and systematic cleanup
- Careful header management (minimal includes, no catch-all headers)
- Consistent coding style and formatting
- Systematic debugging with GDB and Valgrind
- Implementation aligned with industry best practices
- Clear and structured commit messages to support collaboration
